Notation: s for sample standard deviation and Ïƒ for population standard deviation.</para><para id="eip-612"><title>Variance (Random Variable)</title>A characteristic of interest in a population being studied. Common notation for variables are upper case Latin letters 
X, 
Y, 
Z,...; common notation for a  specific value from the domain (set of all possible values of a variable) are lower case Latin letters 
x, 
y, 
z,.... For example, if 
X is the number of children in a family, then 
x represents a specific  integer 0, 1, 2, 3, .... Variables in statistics differ from variables in intermediate algebra in two following ways. 

<newline/>(1). The domain of the random variable (RV) is not necessarily a numerical set; the domain may be expressed in words; for example, if 
X = hair color then the domain is {black, blond, gray, green, orange}.  <newline/>(2). We can tell what specific value  
x of the Random Variable   
X takes only after performing the experiment.</para></section>
